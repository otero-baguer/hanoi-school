# Exercises for the Inverse Problems and Deep Learning School in Hanoi, Vietnam 

Here you will find the course exercises as well as the solutions. I will upload the exercises gradually so using it as a Git repository is a good idea, otherwise you can download everyday the updated .zip with all the files.


## Installation instructions

### 1) Create folder for the exercises 
If you are using Git, then this happens automatically, otherwise download a .zip file with the content of the repository and uncompress it.

### 2) Install Python

For the exercises we are going to use Python (Miniconda distribution).

The installer files for all platforms (Windows, Lunix, Mac) can be found in:

[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Please download the appropiate installer and run it.

 - If your computer has a 64-bit operating system (most likely) select the *64-bit installer* for *Python 3.7*.

 - If your system has a 32-bit operating system (unlikely) you will need to install the *32-bit installer* for *Python 3.7*.
 
 - If you get asked if you want to add the Miniconda directory to the `PATH` select yes.
 
Please confirm that you have successfully installed Miniconda by opening a console and typing `conda`.
 
### 3) Install required packages

The list of required packages is contained in the file [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt). To install all of them open a console on the folder where you have the file and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
